Notes

SECTION 1:

Lesson 1
    - Welcome to the course
    - Intro stuff not super relavant information
    - Basically talks about what react is
    - What are components? Use a component in first section
    - Write your own component

Lesson 3:
    - What is it?
        - Front end framework/library from Facebook
    - What does it do?
        - Main point is for components so you can build larger apps easier
        - Small components combined to make whole app
Lesson 4:
    - Is react a framework or library?
        - Frameworks are usually larger than library
        - Frameworks are more like blueprints
        - Less freedom with Frameworks because they are "opinionated"
        - Frameworks: Angular, Ember, Vue
    - Angluar is more "out of the box" whereas react is light weight
    - React does 1 main thing - create components to make things easier whereas Angular has a lot more built in
    - React alone is more a library but most people don't use react on its own
    - Usually react is combined with things like react router, webpack, etc.
    - Next.js is a framework built around react
Lesson 5:
    - components are building blocks of react
    - How many parts to break app into?
        - Usually UI and logic
        - example: https://codesandbox.io/s/62x458v5pn
    - Seems like you can really break things up into super small pieces
    - Learning how to know what to break up and what not to break up may be a learning piece
Lesson 6:
    - Modules are reusable but not always exactly the same
    - Combining components to create a larger app like the color picker app
